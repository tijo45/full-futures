The research.json contained verified package versions that were newer than what the spec specified. All 5 core package versions were corrected (ib_async, river, dash, pandas_market_calendars, numpy), dash-bootstrap-components was added as a recommended package, and the Dash import pattern was enhanced. The spec's code patterns, requirements coverage, edge cases, and architectural design were all correct and well-aligned with research findings.",
