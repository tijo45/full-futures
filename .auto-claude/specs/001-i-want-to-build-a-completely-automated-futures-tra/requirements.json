  "task_description": "I want to build a completely automated futures trading bot using interactive brokers python api that trades only tradeable futures contracts (all futures, no stocks/options/forex/crypto) and operates exclusively online with live market data (no offline mode, no backtest-only system). The app should auto discover the best tradable futures contract on startup. The system must be fully autonomous end-to-end and must not rely on hard-coded values, fixed strategies, static thresholds, or CLI configs; instead, it must self-discover, self-calibrate, and self-adapt dynamically from live data and ongoing trading results.\n\nThe explicit goal is ultra-aggressive capital growth, prioritizing rapid profitability discovery and deployment. The system should optimize for risk-adjusted returns using Sharpe ratio (or equivalent dynamic performance metric) while aggressively seeking to increase profit as quickly as possible. The bot must rapidly identify what is profitable in the current regime, begin trading as soon as statistically meaningful profitability is detected, and then scale participation immediately while continuously monitoring degradation in performance.\n\nThe bot must generate fast, real-time predictions, continuously validate those predictions using live collected data, and measure rolling accuracy, confidence, and contribution to risk-adjusted returns. It should only place trades when predictive accuracy and confidence are high, and must always select the highest-confidence opportunity available at any given moment across all eligible futures contracts.\n\nThe system must be capable of trading across every market session, all volatility regimes, and all training windows, without manual tuning. It must automatically manage Interactive Brokers contract sessions, trading windows, and exchange calendars. If a session is closed or approaching close, the script must handle this autonomously, avoiding impacted entries and exiting positions before session close risk materializes.\n\nThe bot must never trade without verified live market data. It must continuously monitor Interactive Brokers connectivity, market data subscriptions, feed latency, tick freshness, and training workstation health. If any degradation, disconnect, stalled feed, or training instability is detected, the system must immediately halt trading and alert the user. Trading may resume only once live data integrity and system health are fully restored.\n\nMarket inputs must include Level 1 and Level 2 data, and both must be actively leveraged for modeling, validation, confidence estimation, and execution-aware decision-making.\n\nThe bot must continuously learn from losing trades, using them as first-class feedback signals to improve the live model. It must track, store, and adapt confidence levels per prediction, per contract, per regime, and over time, using confidence as a hard gate for entries, scaling, and exits.\n\nThe script must be the only entity interacting with Interactive Brokers for trading actions. It must fully track and manage all orders, positions, fills, exposure, and account state at all times, maintaining authoritative control and reconciliation with IB.\n\nThe primary objective is consistent yet ultra-aggressive growth of the futures brokerage account, explicitly optimizing for speed to profitability, Sharpe ratio improvement, and rapid capital compounding, while remaining fully online, self-correcting, session-aware, and data-integrity-safe.\n\nThis code is running on a mac ultra with a lot of memory and cpu. The bot should utilize 80% all of the resources on this machine to figure out the most profitable way to trade quickly. \n\nFinally, the system must provide a real-time visualization/dashboard displaying:\n\t•\tCurrent and historical confidence levels\n\t•\tLive training and adaptation states\n\t•\tActive and monitored futures contracts\n\t•\tOpen trades, orders, positions, and exposure\n\t•\tCurrent session profit and loss (P&L)\n\t•\tKey performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win/loss adaptation signals)\n\nI already have Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation running in the background on a demo account, so the system is free to experiment aggressively, explore strategies, and adapt rapidly in live simulated conditions without restriction.",
